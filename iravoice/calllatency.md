# Call Latency Monitoring

## Live Latency Monitoring

For real-time latency analysis, you can monitor the IraVoice dashboard, which provides several network and streaming metrics, including:

* SSL handshake time
* WebSocket (WSS) connection delays
* WebSocket socket errors
* Other streaming and network-related metrics

## Post-Call Latency Analysis

After calls are completed, latency and quality metrics can be analyzed using the Call Event CDRs received on the webhook endpoint.

The following events are useful:

### 1. `call_quality`

This event provides overall call quality information, including:

* MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
* Quality

This helps evaluate the overall user experience for each call.

### 2. `stream_stopped`

This event contains detailed stream-level latency metrics within the `setup_delays` parameter, including:

* Start time
* SSL handshake delays
* Average bot delay
* WSS/WebSocket connection delays

#### Example

```json
"setup_delays": {
  "started": "2026-05-15T11:39:17.813164Z",
  "resolve": 0,
  "connect": 0,
  "ssl_handshake": 4641,
  "wss_handshake": 36,
  "first_audio": 16,
  "att": 0,
  "awt": 0,
  "abd": 13
}
```

Unlike the dashboard, which shows averaged metrics across calls, the `stream_stopped` event provides per-call visibility, making it useful for debugging specific latency issues.
